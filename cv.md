Experience - Research
==================
## Carnegie Mellon University Chemical Engineering Department &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2008-present
- Ph. D Thesis Research, Advised by Prof. B. Erik Ydstie and Prof. Dennis C. Prieve
- System of study: The interaction of interfaces in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs) both during cell production and cell operation. Current losses due to leakage at undesired faults in the device have been characterized, and colloid science has been utilized to reduce these losses in an easily scalable manner.
- Key Results and Experience Gained:
    - Solid surfaces used in thin film solar technology were characterized according to zeta potentials in aqueous solutions, mimicking manufacturing conditions.
    - Titania particles were deposited onto conductive substrates using a novel, aqueous method at low temperature, in contrast to sputtering.
    - Solar cells were constructed and tested in-house using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.
    - Dynamic and steady-state modeling using finite-difference methods was developed for the system, allowing for system boundaries to be better described than previously demonstrated.
- Award for excellence in Student Teaching in 2 courses, 5 courses taught during studies.
